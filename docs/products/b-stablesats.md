Stablesats is a part of the Galoy OSS banking stack. It enables users that deposit Bitcoin to hold a USD denominated value in their wallets. It achieves this by identifying transactions that involve a hard-coded dealer ledger account in the Galoy ledger and calculating a target liability. This liability is subsequently hedged via shorting perpetual swap contracts on the okex exchange.
